//The memory size for data types can vary depending on the system and compiler, but here are typical sizes in C/C++:
//int: Usually 4 bytes (32 bits)
//char: 1 byte (8 bits)
//float: Usually 4 bytes (32 bits)
//These sizes can differ on some systems, especially with different compilers or architectures.
// For example, on some platforms, an int could be 2 bytes (16 bits), and a float could also vary.
